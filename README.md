Template for Flask based webapps (mostly based on the Flask Mega-Tutorial series that begins at http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Installation
------------
# Setup a virtual environment with all the required modules
# python3 -m venv flask --without-pip
# source flask/bin/activate
# ./flask_venv.sh
 
# deactivate

The sqlite database must also be created before the application can run, and the `db_create.py` script takes care of that. See the [Database tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database) for the details.

Running
-------
Run run.py
